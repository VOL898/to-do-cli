# CLI based To-Do list

This is a project for my Object-Oriented Programming class in Binus University Semester 2

It is a to do list based on a command line interface so that it is not heavy on ram or cpu. This idea was made by me and my group and the documentation can be seen in the file OOP_Final Project_Documentation.pdf

This project was done with 5 other team members.
